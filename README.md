# Full Throttle: A Detailed Overview of Everything F1
**Design and Narrative**

Our website will use simple text html forms, used in its login page and favorite driver display. To make the form functional and save user inputted information to our website, we will be utilizing HTML5 local storage, which would be done by using JS document.getElementById to assign the inputted information to certain variables. Afterwards, we would use localStorage.setItem() to take in the information and assign a key to it, which localStorage.getItem() will retrieve and use to fill in the required information to areas with the same key name every time the user logs back in. For the form’s design elements, its layout would follow the basic form structure, with input boxes requesting certain information from the user arranged vertically, and its CSS would mostly coincide with the other webpages, only having minimal changes like a different background to slightly separate it from the rest of the website.

**New Webpages with HTML**
*F1 fan/user registration* The user will enter their information(email address, chosen username, password, favorite current team, favorite current driver). The data from this HTML page will be saved onto the said user’s local storage; the data will still be saved if the webpage is closed. There will then be an option to continue to the user’s personalized webpage.
*Dashboard* The dashboard will be made to the user’s preferences, it will display the user's data(username, favorite current team, favorite current driver), and other information related to their preferences. 
*Favorites* This webpage will display the stats of their favorite current driver and team(driver’s race starts, wins, podiums, poles, fastest laps, championships, best season points wise, biggest rivals, team’s championships, best cars, best season points wise, best drivers)
